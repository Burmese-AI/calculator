# calculatorByElliott_bot
A telegram chatbot that can help users to calculate math problems. Not only simple problems, it can solve trigonometric problems. However, the user must put only valid mathematical notations recognized by Python. i.e. Users should use '*' and '/' to multiply and divide. And if no sign is between two brackets (e.g., (3+4)(9+8)), the bot won't multiply the two brackets automatically. '*' should be put between brackets (e.g., (3+4)*(9+8) )

Users can calculate by calling /calculate command or sending the math problem to the bot. 
Users can also calculate by mentioning the bot (inline query) in any chat on Telegram.
