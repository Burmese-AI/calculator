# calculatorByElliott_bot
A telegram chatbot that can help user to calculate math problems. Not only simple problems, it can solve trigonometric problems. However, user must put only valid mathematical notations recognized by Python. i.e. Users should use '*' and '/' to multiply and divide. And if no sign is between two brackets (e.g., (3+4)(9+8)), the bot won't multiply the two brackets automatically.
